        "body":"Plateo is an application where users can follow and create conversations based on license plates, hence the name. Have you ever wondered if the person on the side of the road needed help or if they were okay? Or did you want to let the person ahead of you know that their gas cap was open or they have a burnt out taillight? Or tell the cute guy or girl next to you to pull over for an ice cream at the next McDonalds? Not only do these conversations in the app allow people to communicate on the road but also allow local authorities to monitor driving behavior. Users could report or comment on a license plate saying the person's driving was bad or spot a drunk driver or someone texting and driving. I built this application using Angular, Bootstrap, Auth0, Node.js, Express, and Mongo DB.",

        "body":"Arbit is a Node.js application that was created to arbitrage crypto currency exchanges. The idea being that you could buy a coin on Exchange X for a lower price and then sell on Exchange Y for a higher price since the prices differed between exchanges. As I built out the application I ran practice scenarios to see my profit margins and boy I tell you they looked great, but there was one problem, transaction speeds. If you have dabbled in crypto currency at all you know that transactions can take a long time to process; with long processing times the profits diminished. I looked to alt coins for faster transactions, but still not quick enough to send funds from one exchange to another and then after fees make a decent profit. Arbit gathered prices and fees from the following exchanges: Gemini, Kraken, Binance, Bittrex, and GDAX.",

Via the dashboard users could create, delete, and edit blog posts. To support this workflow I built a RESTful API using Node.js and auth0 to secure it. Using role-based access control I allowed admins read and write access and subscribers read-only access. For my data store I used Mongo DB and for the user interface I used Angular. This project was a great way to put my skills to use.",
